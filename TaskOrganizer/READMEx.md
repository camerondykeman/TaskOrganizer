#Taskly

##What is Taskly?

Taskly is a simply task tracker WPF designed 
to organize your current tasks on a scale of 
how badly you need to get them finished.


##Why are you working on this?

I'm tired of writing out lists of things to do
and then having to rewrite it once I figure out
what priority each task deserves.

Taskly is the result of that need paired with
a desire to completely overengineer a
college WPF assignment.


##How can I get me some Taskly?

Task away:
go get github.com/camerondykeman/TaskOrganizer


##This thing is terrible.
